# AI Usage in Kee

AI was used to assist with the creation of Kee chatbot

These are the following uses:

AI was used to prompt for good software engineering practices.
For example, I sent my long methods (>30 lines) into ChatGPT and asked how
I can go about breaking down my code and applying SLAP principles.

AI was used to learn CSS and JavaFX. As I wanted to create a nice GUI,
I learnt JavaFX and CSS using ChatGPT. For example, I prompted ChatGPT
with "How do I make my button less opaque when clicked" and 
"How do I switch names when for the text message of different users"
